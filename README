U-Boot Image Builder Manifest
-----------------------------

This is a simple tool for build Arm firmware images from U-Boot,
Trusted Firmware A, and the Linux devicetree repo. It uses the
git 'repo' tool to clone a copy of each project and a Makefile
to build for various Arm targets.

Using this tool
---------------
This tool uses the git 'repo' tool to build firmware.
Install repo first

To initialize the build environment, create a new working directory
and run the repo init command:

  $ mkdir firmware-working
  $ cd firmware-working
  $ repo init -u https://github.com/glikely/u-boot-manifest
  $ repo sync

This will clone all of the required git trees and link the Makefile
into the root directory. To build the firmware, simply type:

  $ make <target_name>_defconfig

Where <target_name> is a U-Boot defconfig that can be found in the
u-boot/configs directory.

Patches to target projects
--------------------------
There are a few changes to the main projects in the ./patches directory.
You'll may need to apply those to get a working firmware image.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
1. Macchiato-bin
3. RockPro64 (incomplete)
